    description: |-
      Using your in-depth understanding of data-driven research methods you are able to plan the development of analytic applications, evaluate the range of data management challenges to be expected, and identify solutions that fit the research purpose and level of complexity involved.  Your plan articulates the potential insights and risks of data intensive research in your domain, relating these to ethical and FAIR principles, and funders’ policies. You give support and supervision in planning data management and stewardship to team members, and contribute to development of support services through your peer network and liaison with senior colleagues in professional services.

    description: |-
      Being responsible and accountable for your research team’s activities and behaviour, you have in-depth understanding of the legal, ethical aspects of research, including principles for making research outputs FAIR. You are able to evaluate and manage the opportunities to demonstrate good practice from data-driven research. You apply knowledge of current data ethics issues and their implications for research integrity in your domain, to manage the risks to individual and institutional reputations that ethical and/or legal infringement would jeopardise. You define the responsibilities of staff or students, and communicate effectively with them and with professional support staff.

      Using your in-depth knowledge of repositories for data, code or other outputs (such as samples or protocols) , you liase with data stewards to recommend repositories and other services that are a good fit to the needs of researchers in your area, e.g. the characteristics of their data, and their data management processes.  You provide expert advice on data formats and vocabularies relevant to your research domain, and on the deposition processes of repositories, whether these are locally provided or external. This advice includes appropriate constraints on how FAIR the research outputs will be, depending e.g. on assessment of ethical impacts, data protection, or licensing and IP rights.
