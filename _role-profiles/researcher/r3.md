      With your in-depth knowledge of funding bodies policy expectations towards research data management, and the application of FAIR principles to other research outputs, you initiate process for managing data, software code, and other outputs across your research team. Taking account of the data sources, formats, and research methods your team will use, and disciplinary norms applicable in your research field, you set the parameters for local guidance, aligning this with data policies and processes of the wider organisation and your funders. You liase with relevant professional services, e.g. data stewards, to develop templates for Data Management Plans and then monitor and support the application of them to research you supervise, including PhD students where appropriate.

    description: |-
      From your experience in building collaborative projects and a network of peers you have in-depth understanding of the need for effort to be recognised, cited and acknowledged. Fully aware of research integrity principles and codes of professional research conduct you are able to formulate  guidelines for your research group on their practices for citing data, code and methods that they reuse. The students and early career researchers you supervise know how to acknowledge collaborators, technicians or others who have contributed to results, as co-authors where appropriate. You contribute to establishing standards in your domain for crediting those who helped with collection, management, documentation, publication and archiving of research outputs,  and can offer guidance on applying standard output identifiers (e.g. DOIs) researcher identifiers (e.g. ORCID) and contributor roles (e.g. the [CRediT](https://casrai.org/credit/) taxonomy).

    description: |-
      From your involvement in obtaining funding for research, and in recruiting staff, you are aware of current moves by funders and institutions towards including criteria for open research in funding and recruitment criteria. You liase with funders regarding priorities for data-intensive research, and understand how to meet and influence their expectations regarding FAIR and open outputs. You are able to budget for costs of research data management and sharing in all grant applications. You seek guidance on costs where appropriate from relevant advisory services.

    description: |-
      You draw on your relationship with senior colleagues and encourage them to support you in influencing changes in your research group, including its hiring and promotion decisions. You are able to encourage colleagues and the staff you supervise to adopt practices that will make research outputs as FAIR and open as possible, and to use your influence to ensure they are recognised and rewarded for their efforts in doing so. You contribute to debates in your institution or research field on the application of FAIR principles, research integrity and open science to your context.
