    description: |-
      You have in-depth understanding of your organisation's RDM policy, and of the policies of relevant research funders in relation to planning for FAIR outputs, including Data Management Plans. You have in-depth knowledge of  the legal and ethical frameworks applicable to the research communities you support. You are also familiar with these communities’ research methods, tools, standards and services used locally.   You are able to translate this knowledge and understanding into Data Management Plan (DMP) templates for the researchers you support, providing expert advice appropriate to  all career stages.  You can articulate how planning benefits the researcher as the ‘first reuser’ of their outputs, and seek help where needed from other professional services.

    description: |-
      Aware of relevant (inter)national data and e-infrastructure services you identify and respond to the needs of researchers and stakeholders in the areas you support for FAIR tools, services or resources. You provide guidance and instruction on discovery, acquisition and (re-)use of data, including local collection and those in the public domain. You ensure these are as open possible to reuse, according to organisational policy and legal obligations. Liaising with relevant professional services, e.g. research software engineers and data service architects, you develop and implement standard solutions for recurring issues and deliver training on their effective application, also ensuring that the organisation’s service management processes are followed.

    description: |-
      You provide researchers in fields you support with examples of FAIR and open data or software that advances research, and describe the relevance of FAIR principles to the norms for validation or reproducibility in their domains. You provide expert advice on making data findable, and on cleaning data to make it actionable and interoperable for reuse. Knowledgeable about ethical and commercial constraints on data access, you liaise with relevant professional services and systems. You provide expert advice on appraising and selecting data of value for reuse, and on good practice in managing software code, including versioning and documentation.

    description: |-
      Using your in-depth knowledge of repositories for data, code or other outputs (such as samples or protocols), you direct researchers in your area to these repositories and other services that are a good fit to their domain, the characteristics of their data, and their data management processes. You provide expert advice to researchers in your area on data formats and vocabularies relevant to their research domains, and on the deposition processes of repositories, whether these are locally provided or external. You liaise with relevant professional services to ensure appropriate constraints on how FAIR the research outputs will be, depending e.g. on assessment of ethical impacts, data protection, or licensing and IP rights.
